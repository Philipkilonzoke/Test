Update my website to fetch and display real-time news articles across these 8 categories, ensuring that each category page shows only articles specific to that category.  
All articles must properly load with their titles, descriptions, and images displayed clearly.  
Ensure there is no duplication of articles within each category or across different categories — each article should appear only once per relevant category.  
Each category page must also properly include the website footer and support the 12 available themes seamlessly, so the footer and themes work consistently across all 8 categories.

- Latest news — fetch the most recent and trending news articles from all topics and sources, without filtering by category or country. This is a general feed of the newest headlines.

- Kenyan news — fetch news articles that are specifically about Kenya, or reported by Kenyan news sources. Articles should cover Kenyan politics, economy, sports, culture, and society — but only if they are directly related to Kenya.

- Sports — fetch only sports-related news, including football, athletics, basketball, tournaments, match results, player transfers, and other sports events worldwide.

- Technology — fetch only technology-related news, including gadgets, software, artificial intelligence, startups, apps, tech company news, scientific innovations, and emerging technologies.

- Business — fetch only business and finance news, including stock markets, corporate news, entrepreneurship, investments, economic trends, trade, and commerce.

- Health — fetch only health-related news, such as updates on diseases, medical research, fitness, mental health, healthcare policies, hospitals, and wellness.

- Entertainment — fetch only entertainment-related news, including movies, TV shows, celebrities, musicians, concerts, awards, cultural events, and lifestyle stories.

- World news — fetch only international and global news not specific to Kenya. Focus on major world events, international relations, conflicts, diplomacy, global economy, and worldwide stories.
